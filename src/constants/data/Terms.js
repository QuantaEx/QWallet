We do not collect and save any of your private data by ourself with one exception: when you activate notifications for one account we will save a mapping between the Address in question and a FCM push key to send you the push.  Your private keys, which are generated by QWallet are only stored locally on your device and are never shared automatically. You can manually share them if you wish (e.g. to transfer them to another device).
